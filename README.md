# Crowdfunding_ETL

In Jupyter Notebook, open the file ETL_Mini_Project_Working.ipnyb and run all cells.

Then, using PGAdmin, create a database called 'crowdfunding_db' and open a query tool. Use the crowdfunding_db_schema to first drop the tables if they exist (lines 10-13), then create the tables (lines 17-69). At this point you can use the select * statements (lines 73-76) to check that the tables were created correctly. Import the matching CSV files into each table, making sure to import the 'campaign' table last. This will prevent issues with foreign keys. Now you can use the select * statements again, to make sure that the CSVs imported into the tables correctly.


Worked with Max Leuthner, Zach Rehfuss, and Toka Hassan.
Used Xpert Learning Assistant for debugging.
